## Contributing 

Loom uses [Granite](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite) as a backing for components and services. The Components folder in this repo serves as a good example for many future components that may be needed. Any suggestions on Granite or other component layouts as a whole is greatly appreciated. Always feel free to open a PR and/or Issue.

### Why Granite?

Mostly because of *Relays*. These work like environment objects, but are more flexible in initializations. No need to passdown directly. The ability to simply declare relays in any `View` or `GraniteComponent` allows for a more effective iterative process and cleaner context passing throughout the application.

```swift
@Relay var configService: ConfigService
```
