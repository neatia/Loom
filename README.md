## Contributing 

Loom uses [Granite](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite) as a backing for components and services. The Components folder in this repo serves as a good example for many future components that may be needed. Any suggestions on Granite or other component layouts as a whole is greatly appreciated. Always feel free to open a PR and/or Issue.

An interactive websites to generate boilerplate components using a GUI to define styling and needed state properties is in the works! This will allow you to simply download the generated component and drag into XCode for immediate use.

### Why Granite?

Mostly because of *Relays* and project organization. I'd say testing too, but once I get around towards writing the unit tests, I'd feel more confident in sharing the strengths then. These work like @Observables/@AppStorage, but are more flexible in initializations and caching data. The ability to simply declare relays in any `View` or `GraniteComponent` allows for a more effective iterative process and cleaner context passing throughout the application.

```swift
@Relay var configService: ConfigService
```
